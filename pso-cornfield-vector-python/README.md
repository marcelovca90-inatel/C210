# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
## The Cornfield Vector implementation in Python

This code is an example of using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the global minimum of the [Sphere function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization) based on [Particle Swarm Optimization from Scratch with Python](https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-17/simple-particle-swarm-optimization-with-python/) by Nathan Rooy (August 17, 2016).
